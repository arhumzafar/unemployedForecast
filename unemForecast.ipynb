    "In this notebook, I use 3 months of data to predict the unemployment rate for the following month. With the decision to use linear regression as a baseline model, I then compare performance from a random forest model, XGBoost, and long short-term memory (LSTM). Furthermore, I use both mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as evaluation metrics.\n"
